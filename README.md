## Projet Title: 

### Adaboost_ADSL

## Projet Description: 

This code was made for the Advanced Supervised Learning projet for the Mastet Data Mining of University Lyon 2 in 2021. 
The code has the implementation of an Binary and MultiClass Adaboost referenced from the pseudocodes of Freund et al 1997. 
This code also has some experiments to compare the algorithm coded with other machine learning models, with the standard
scikit learn library and some tuning parameters. 

This code is written on Python with the help of some standard machine learning libraries. 

## How to Run: 

The main code was made to be run in the command line from the code/ folder.
You have to set a data parameter if you want a binary or a multiclas problem. 
We have set some standard datasets for each problem. 

Exemples: 
- For a binary problem run:
    >  python .\main.py -d binary
- For a multiclass problem run:
    >  python .\main.py -d multiclass
